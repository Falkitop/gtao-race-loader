FiveM resource that allows to drive community-made races from GTA Online.

This resource can be seen as a more feature-rich version of https://github.com/jaymo1011/mission-json-loader

the lua_getrace.py is getting a jsonstring from anywhere you want to and it loads it automatically.

use it by writing /race into console


## TODO
- In-Game non-admin command execution works but some things do not get loaded
- Old Rocket Pickups do not work (Missile doesn't launch when picking up)
- Transformraces aren't yet supported
- Different Checkpoint types like air races aren't supported

Help is much appreciated
